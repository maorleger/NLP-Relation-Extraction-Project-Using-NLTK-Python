README

pre-requisites:
1. python2.6 or higher with NLTK installed

2. The following data should be available to NLTK: maxent_ne_chunker, words, and wordnet
	To install the above data enter the following in order into a terminal window:
	python2.6
	import nltk
	nltk.download()
	d maxent_ne_chunker
	d words
	d wordnet
	q
	CTRL + d (to exit Python console)
3. The following files and folders should be available (assuming you are in the project's directory):
	1. ./project.py
	2. ./project_scorer.py
	3. ./MaxEntCreatModel.jar
	4. ./MaxEntPredict.jar
	5. ./data/training

running:
1. cd into the project's root directory and type the following into a terminal windows:
2. project:
	python2.6 project.py [-v] testingFileName outputFileName
	where testingFileName is the relative path to the testing file and outputFileName is the desired name of the output file
3. scorer:
	python2.6 project_scorer [-v] outputFileName
	where outputFileName is the relative path to the file just created in step (2)
ex:
python2.6 project.py -v data/dev data/output
python2.6 project_scorer.py data/output
